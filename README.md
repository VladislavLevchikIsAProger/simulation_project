The point of the project is a step-by-step simulation of a 2D world populated by herbivores and predators. In addition to creatures, the world contains resources (grass), which the herbivores feed on, and static objects with which you can't interact - they just fill the space.The idea for the project was taken from [here](https://zhukovsd.github.io/java-backend-learning-course/Projects/Simulation/)

## About
Functionality implemented in this project: 
  + Ability to create a world from 10x10 to 15x15 in size. All static objects and creatures will be added automatically.
  + The world simulation can be paused at any time.
  + While the simulation is paused, you can add, remove or replace different entities in the world.
  + Grass that has been eaten has a 50% chance to regrow.
  + Creatures can move on any object on the map. They move one cell.
  + For balance, automatic addition of grass is implemented if there is not enough grass in the world.
